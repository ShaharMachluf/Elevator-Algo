# Elevator-Algo
This repository is a smart elevator online algoritm.
I programed this with a partner as an assignment in Ariel university as part of my OOP course.
This was the first assignment.
The goal of this algorithm is to make a smart elevator that minimize the waiting time for each person and minimize the average waiting time for everyone.
The most importent class of this program is the Ex0 class which contains the algorithm itself.
There are also the classes Building, Elevator and CallForElevator that are used in the algirithm and the tests.
The main class is made to simulate different cases for diffrent buildings, elevators and calls.
